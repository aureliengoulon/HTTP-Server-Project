# Micro-web-server
Simple micro web client and server

================
The goal of this mini-project was to implement a message checking mechanism. The web server is listening on port 8080.
Each request is processed to make sure it is an HTTP request. In the following step, the server checks if the requested file is available.
Finally, the server sends a response with the appropriate code and message to the client.
